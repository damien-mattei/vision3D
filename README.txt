Vision 3D is a 3D engine used in a pedagogic way to learn the basis of 3D computation, there exist faster 3D engine such as openGL,GPU,etc. The project first started on a Apple II in basic for ray tracing, it is being ported to C++ under Linux and Mac OS X. For now the 3D kernel is ok but i have not find time to continue more. Importance is set on giving to community a clean code that could be useful both to learn C++ or/and the mathematic of 3D computing. Emphasis has been set to make C++ class in the orthodox canonical class form of Coplien,use template  and to comment and give extra material to  understand algorithms and mathematics relations used in the program. This program is written by Damien Mattei (Nice - France) .
